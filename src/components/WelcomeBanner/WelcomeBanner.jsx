Unfortunately, I overslept on the day of my space flight, and tried to hurry up by taking a shortcut through a quantum singularity. Something unexpected happened, because I landed in the wrong time, in the earliest eras of the planet’s past! According to my calculations, the only way out seems to be to travel through all of Earth’s history, and I could really use an Earthling’s help on this journey.
  
  Help me solve the riddles and puzzles of each time period, and collect important historical items and inventions as rewards. Once we’ve gathered them all and are back in the present moment, I can return home again (and continue my nap!).
